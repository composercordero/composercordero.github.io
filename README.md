# Carlos Cordero is Dating JavaScript

Hola, People! My name is Carlos Cordero. This is the repository for my professional portfolio website. I'll be updating this file as I add features to my website.

I create user-centered solutions through writing efficient, clean code, effective communication, and meaningful collaboration. I strive to find creative solutions, listen to my peers, and perform extensive research to be a valuable part of a team, bringing timely, professional contributions to create the best product for our clients.

## Concept

The concept for my portfolio is a personal diary where I tell the user about my journey of dating JavaScript (and other languages). While dating JS, I create wonderful memories, learn new things, go through periods of frustration, but in the end enjoy the overall process of creating a deep connection to JS.
